Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused.

This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.

If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated\n  // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended\n  // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at\n  // the final intended token.\n  //\n  // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal\n  // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes\n  // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost\n  // much less gas than they would otherwise.\n  //\n  // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple\n  // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only\n  // updating the Pool's internal accounting).\n  //\n  // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token\n  // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the\n  // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.\n  //\n  // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after\n  // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).\n  //\n  // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do\n  // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be\n  // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the\n  // same swap.

This means\n * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.\n * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.\n *\n * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide\n * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How\n * to implement supply mechanisms].\n *\n * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n * applications.\n *\n * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\n *\n * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\n * allowances.
